    "Two men who had profound impact on my journey with the tribes. Sheikh Mufarreh, with grey hair on the left, is prominent tribal leader from Murad tribe in Marib. I met sheikh Mufarreh in 2005. I was impressed when he told me that 20 years earlier he decided to quit chewing qat, a mildly narcotic leaves that Yemenis chew and enjoy socially, to encourage young men in the tribe to quit it. Throughout his life, he mediated and resolved many tribal conflicts across Yemen. In 2015, he had to lead a tribal force to repel Houthi’s incursion into his tribal territory. He lost four of his sons as a result of the war. To his left is Sharief Salem ben Saud, a tribal leader who devoted his life to resolving and mediating tribal conflicts. In April 2009, he was killed in crossfire when he was trying to stop violent clashes that erupted between his tribe, Al-Ashraf, & Al-Jedaan tribe.",

  title: "The Culture of Apology Tribal Conflict Resolution in Action",
  date: "26 Feb 2023",
  content: `
  <h1>Description of Tribal Conflict Resolution in Yemen</h1> <p> This piece provides a description of how the culture of apology is embedded in tribal conflict resolution in Yemen. It is inspired by a video that captures the start of a tribal mediation process. Please watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=regdnL91mjA">video</a> first, then read the explanation below. And don’t be scared when you hear the shooting. The description below explains what they symbolize. </p> <h2>General Background</h2> <p> Tribal conflict resolution traditions include mediation and arbitration. The mediators' role is to stop violent clashes or potential ones. To prevent the dispute from escalating, they talk to conflict sides and convince them to resolve it either through direct negotiation or through arbitration. If the conflict becomes violent, mediators would rush into the middle of the fighting zone carrying white flags. Warring tribes would stop the clashes and talk to the mediators. That is the rule according to customary law. Mediators would then convince conflict parties to establish an immediate truce (usually 8 days) and choose an arbitrator or arbitrators. Arbitration takes different steps and stages; each has a certain protocol and a level of details and sophistication. Usually, conflict parties agree on an arbitrator or arbitrators who then study the evidence, listen to conflict parties together and in separate caucuses, and then issue a verdict. There is a well-established appeals process if one of the conflict sides is not happy with the verdict. Conflict parties' preapproval of the arbitrator/s is a must. </p> <h2>The Culture of Apology</h2> <p> The culture of apology is rooted in tribal customary law and conflict resolution traditions. This video below along with the transcript and explanation presents a type of arbitration in which one side of the conflict chooses the other side as the arbitrator. This demonstrates a culture of apology and willingness to go as far as required to end the conflict and establish peace beyond that. It is because of these traditions that most conflicts in tribal areas in Yemen did not blow up into full-scale wars. The video presents a real tribal arbitration process in which a tribe from Marib offers apology and amends to a tribe from Al-Baydha after a tribesman from Al-Baydha was killed in the territory of the tribe from Marib. Whether the man was killed by a tribesman or tribesmen from the Marib tribe is not relevant. What matter is that he was killed within the territory of the Marib tribe and that the tribe failed to prevent that from happening. In tribal traditions, each tribe is responsible for protecting people and animals within its territory and that extends to travelers who cross a tribe’s land. To keep it simple and easy to follow, the names of tribes will not be mentioned. The tribe from Marib will be referred to as the Marib tribe and the tribe from Al-Baydha will be referred to as the Al-Baydha tribe. </p> <h2>General Description of the Arbitration Process in the Video</h2> <p> April 5th, 2014, a delegation of armed tribesmen led by tribal sheikhs from Marib drove down and settled in a piece of land within the territory of the victim’s tribe in Al-Baydha governorate. As much as it appears to be so, this is not a sign of aggression. It is far from it. It is rather a demonstration of apology and a kind request by Marib tribesmen to be hosted by Al-Baydha tribe. This tradition aims at appealing to the tribal traditions of hospitality. Marib tribesmen came with a request and an honorable tribe, in this case the Al-Baydha tribe, would honor that request. Marib tribe’s request is for Al-Baydha tribe to agree to be the arbitrators and state whatever amends they want to resolve the conflict that resulted from the killing of their tribesman in Marib tribe’s territory. </p> <h2>Transcript of the Back-and-Forth Between Tribes in the Video</h2>
